## Research Overview {#research-overview}
Throughout my undergraduate and master‚Äôs studies, I have centered my research and academic focus on the modeling and control of dynamical systems.

Around this core, I developed a robust toolkit - ranging from dynamics, optimal control, and recursive estimation to numerical analysis and data-driven system identification - not as independent pursuits, but as necessary and interdependent tools to analyze, estimate, and shape the behavior of complex physical systems.

Specifically, my research interests include:

#### Analytical Dynamics Modeling
I am interested in the analysis on the kinematics and kinetics of dynamical systems based on mechanics principles.
- In my undergraduate research (summer 2023), I worked on the 3D hybrid dynamics modeling and numerical simulations of a [legged hopping robot](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10611545). 
- As a self-driven project, I also modeled and simulated the 3D dynamics of a [wobbling coin rolling along the ground](https://github.com/Zhiheng-Chen/3D-Rolling-Disk-Dynamics-Simulation) (winter 2023). 
- In summer and fall 2024, I worked in the [Marine Robotics Laboratory](https://mrl.engr.wisc.edu/) on the dynamics modeling and simulations of a micro autonomous surface vehicle (MicroASV). 
- One of my current research projects is the dynamics modeling of a flexible robotic fish based on Hamilton's principle. The dynamics involve the sophisticated and interesting interactions among rigid bodies, elastic bodies, and fluids. I have coded up a working simulator of the robotic fish in Julia, and I am currently working on parameter and design optimizations based on the simulation results.

#### Data-Driven Modeling
In addition to analytical modeling, I am also fascinated by system identifications and equation learning for dynamical systems. 
- My research project at Cornell University on the weak formulation of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is supervised by Professor [Anastasia Bizyaeva](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/anastasia-bizyaeva/). We are working towards improving the test functions of the weak-form SINDy to boost the interpretability, efficiency, and noise-robustness of the algorithm. 
- In the MicroASV project, I also designed a weak formulation-based parameter estimation algorithm to iteratively refine the dynamics model. 
- In Spring 2025, I designed the [EKF-ST](https://github.com/Zhiheng-Chen/EKF-ST) algorithm that combines the extended Kalman filter and sequential thresholding techniques. The algorithm enables recursive and simultaneous state estimations and equation learning.

#### Nonlinear Dynamics and Control
I am interested in the analysis and control of dynamical system based on the resulting models.
- I study fixed points, limit cycles, chaotic attractors, and bifurcations of nonlinear dynamical systems.
- In the legged hopping robot project, I designed aerial phase PD controllers to adjust the foot placement.
- In the MicroASV project, I designed LQR and variational principle-based (nonlinear) controllers for the robot, enabling it to accurately perform trajectory tracking tasks.

## Project Demos {#project-demos}
I am happy to share the demos of some of my projects mentioned in my research overview.

#### Rigid-Soft-Fluid Coupling Dynamics of a Robotic Fish 
This is a project I am currently working on. I model the fish as a rigid head and an elastic body connected by a motor-driven revolute joint. I use Hamilton's principle, [elastica theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastica_theory), [Lighthill's elongated body theory](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.1971.0085), and Ritz series approximations to obtain the projected weak form of the equations of motion. Then I code up the numerical simulations in [Julia](https://julialang.org/):

#### 3D Contact Dynamics of a Rolling Disk
This was a self-driven project when I was an undergraduate student at UW-Madison. I modeled the 3D dynamics of the disk (size of a coin) using Lagrange's equations with 6 generalized coordinates. In the rolling phase, the equations of motion are solved in parallel with 3 constraint equations (2 nonholonomic constraints for roll without slip, and 1 holonomic constraint for the height of the contact point). I implememnted the [numerical simulations of the disk](https://github.com/Zhiheng-Chen/3D-Rolling-Disk-Dynamics-Simulation) in MATLAB:

#### Hybrid Dynamics of a Legged Hopping Robot
In my undergraduate research, I was responsible for the 3D hybrid dynamics modeling and numerical simulations of a single-legged hopping robot named [PogoX](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10611545). I modeled PogoX as 2 rigid bodies connected by a prismatic joint. The hybrid dynamics model consists of the aerial phase, the impact mapping, and the stance phase, assuming a smooth transition from the stance phase to the aerial phase. I coded up the numerical simulations in MATLAB:

</div>

#### EKF-ST for Simultaneous State Estimation and Equation Learning
This is an individual course project from my Model-Based Estimation course at Cornell University. I devised the [EKF-ST](https://github.com/Zhiheng-Chen/EKF-ST) algorithm (extended Kalman filter with sequential thresholding). The algorithm enables simultaneous and recursively refined state estimations and sparse system identifications for nonlinear dynamical systems. EKF-ST adds a thresholding process to the original EKF prediction-update loops to prune the spurious basis functions and the corresponding covariances.

## Moments {#moments}
Outside of research, I enjoy swimming, practicing boxing, and (occasionally) rowing. I‚Äôm also passionate about rope-skipping ‚Äî during an international competition, I placed 11th worldwide in the triple-under grand final and 7th nationally in the double-under final!


Here are a few videos from my training and competition moments:
- [25-meter butterfly stroke](assets/Butterfly.mp4)
- [Triple-under rope-skipping grand final](assets/RopeSkipping-TrippleUnder.mp4)
- [Double-under rope-skipping practice](assets/RopeSkipping-DoubleUnder.mp4)
- [Boxing drills with my coach: distance control, feints, and counter-punching](assets/Boxing.mp4)
- [Sync or swim ‚Äî sculling drills with my teammate](assets/Rowing.mp4). We eventually took home a [bronze medal](assets/RowingMedal.jpg)!
